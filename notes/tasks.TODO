Goals View:
 ☐ make all other edit/delete buttons unclickable while editing/adding a goal
 ☐ solution: make flash appear via js (deleting a goal using ajax to prevent page reload, problem: flash message doesnt show until redirect.)

Views:
 ☐ New post view could use a little work
 ☐ settings divs could be shortened up a bit (fields are too big)
 ☐ sign up view form is a little big

Authorization:
  ☐ user can edit and delete their own comments
  ☐ admin can remove a comment
  ☐ admin can delete all comments

Home Page:
  ☐ change 3 column layout
  ☐ remove connections until they are needed

Goal Hours:
  ☐ allow user to add an hour from profile page
  ☐ allow user to add an hour from home page
  ☐ add form into sidebar to allow user to select goal (drop down), add a time amount and a description, submit, and view the goal
