Am I There Yet?:
Goals --- ✄ -----------------------
 ☐ make all other edit/delete buttons unclickable while editing/adding a goal
 ☐ solution: make flash appear via js (deleting a goal using ajax to prevent page reload, problem: flash message doesnt show until redirect.)
Views --- ✄ -----------------------
 ☐ New post view could use a little work
 ☐ What about curating comments? An admin should be allowed to remove offensive comments, or to clear an entire list of comments.
 ☐ settings divs could be shortened up a bit (fields are too big)
